# Pen.coffee || Pen.js

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Monochromefx/pen-coffee.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Monochromefx/pen-coffee)

## Tree/Experimental
**Note on Experimental is that this is to see if I could change the way pen does its job without effecting any of the other branches directly.**

Now there is no comments in the main file **Pen.js | Pen.coffee**,
Reason being is because I know for a fact that even comments takes up driver space, So it is kept to a minimum or none at all.
